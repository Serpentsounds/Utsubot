[10:44:52] <leaf-green> So... how's it going?
[10:44:54] <Serpentsounds> is it an automated trivia or manually evaluated?
[10:45:00] <Soki> automated

[10:45:22] <Serpentsounds> so no face-keyboarding :p
[10:45:25] <Soki> most of the time asking for TM numbers:P
[10:45:51] <Serpentsounds> welp
[10:46:06] <leaf-green> i hope you can type fast Serpentsounds
[10:46:19] <Soki> leaf-green I'm doing fine! had a nice sandwich, did some groceries and now am all done for another round:P how are you?
[10:46:20] <Serpentsounds> i can hold my own, but i'm bad with TM numbers
[10:46:44] * Quits: Arthadox (Mibbit@SystemNet-B46D90E7.lns2.wel.bigpond.net.au) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[10:46:56] <Serpentsounds> on the other hand, i do have a pokemon database set up on this machine...
[10:47:02] <Serpentsounds> but i'm not that dishonorable ;o
[10:47:04] <Soki> well you can at least try to join so you can see what kind of questions are asked, in four hours there's another round, the last one
[10:47:26] <Soki> oh most of us have a TM list with us, so you're fine:P
[10:47:29] <leaf-green> Soki good to hear.. i
[10:47:36] <Serpentsounds> oh wtf
[10:47:43] <leaf-green> m good... had a relaxing 3 hours haha
[10:47:49] <Soki> nice
[10:48:10] <leaf-green> Serpentsounds... you learn after your first round hahaha :P
[10:48:15] <Serpentsounds> hehe

[10:48:25] <Serpentsounds> so there's nothing that's really considered cheating then?
[10:48:54] <leaf-green> you don't have time to cheat
[10:49:04] <Soki> I don't think so, I was told lists were fine (as long as you look the info up on bulbapedia)
[10:49:23] <Soki> but indeed you don't have time for anything else, as soon as the question is asked, the first one who answers wins that question
[10:49:35] <Soki> 150 questions will be asked, the person who answers the most correctly and the fastest wins
[10:49:42] <Serpentsounds> what i'm getting at is, a computer can probably answer the question faster than a human <_<
[10:49:43] <Deltafish> where did all these people come from
[10:49:43] <Mijzelffan> sometimes you have time to look it up if no one knows it, like that king question last round
[10:49:51] <leaf-green> if you look to your right you will see super fast Mijzelffan...
[10:50:04] <Soki> oh no mijzelf is back
[10:50:08] <Mijzelffan> hopefully the fastest one this time without chibs and archive lol
[10:50:12] * Quits: WildJr (Mibbit@SystemNet-F83C8D51.alshamil.net.ae) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[10:50:21] <Deltafish> who needs looking things up when you have a bot/script that auto-answers :^)
[10:50:31] <Serpentsounds> precisely
[10:50:41] <Deltafish> which i'm sure none of us have
[10:50:50] <Serpentsounds> i can almost guarantee that after observing this round i could make a program that is guaranteed to win for the round later today :p
[10:50:59] <Mijzelffan> who needs looking up things when you've memorized half the questions you've seen
[10:51:18] <Soki> yeah you just have to stop sleeping and you'll win after 6 rounds
[10:51:22] <Soki> no bots needed
[10:51:30] <Mijzelffan> that's basically the pattern I've seen so far lmao
[10:51:38] <Mijzelffan> this is my 4th round hopefully it'll be enough
[10:51:52] <Soki> my 5th round D:
[10:52:06] <Soki> but you were extremely fast last time, so my bet's on you
[10:52:21] <Serpentsounds> well, i'm not out to ruin anyone's fun, so we'll hold off on the automation :p
[10:52:27] <Mijzelffan> you were pretty fast too though!
[10:52:47] * Joins: WildJr (Mibbit@SystemNet-F83C8D51.alshamil.net.ae)
[10:52:49] <Mijzelffan> I just hope no dangerous new challengers appear
[10:52:50] <Soki> well I was third last time, which I AM quite proud of:P
[10:52:53] <Serpentsounds> i'm usually pretty fast on trivia...but i did just get my first mx green keyboard the other day, still adjusting to that

[11:57:08] <Sou> i'd forget it in 3 minutes
[11:57:11] <Soki> only you could do that
[11:57:12] <Sou> memorizing fails me xD
[11:57:14] <Mijzelffan> I visualize the region and then put the tm number on every town the gym leader is in
[11:57:15] <pieguy> "memorized" = print out next to the computer? :D
[11:57:19] <Soki> ....
[11:57:20] <Soki> wow
[11:57:24] <Blink> I memorized the unova horoscope and the adventures stuff, and ignored TMs lol
[11:57:25] <Mijzelffan> lists don't work lol
[11:57:28] <Mijzelffan> I tried that before
[11:57:31] <Soki> yeah they do
[11:57:32] <Mijzelffan> memory is the fastest
[11:57:32] <Chibster> it does for me haha
[11:57:32] <Blink> agreed, lists don't work
[11:57:33] <Soki> helped me a lot
[11:57:41] <Mijzelffan> I only use a list for tcg sets
[11:57:42] <Blink> if someone memorizes they
[11:57:44] <Blink> are faster
[11:57:47] <Mijzelffan> and the horoscope
[11:57:50] <Soki> yeah but I can never do that
[11:57:54] <Sou> ^
[11:57:56] <Soki> so lists are the only other option lol

[11:59:03] <Soki> yes the questions repeat
[11:59:03] <pieguy> !stats
[11:59:07] <Soki> that's why we know so much:P

[11:59:13] <Chibster> hahah
[11:59:22] <Sou> maybe :o
[11:59:25] <Mijzelffan> I also tried to memorize the manga protag's their skills and starters but I failed under pressure for those still lol
[11:59:26] <Blink> yes agreed, wouldn't have known anything if not for repeating questions
[11:59:28] <pieguy> !banana
[11:59:42] <Laspandrea> no, usually the commad work
[11:59:43] <ewormPL> just read the PokéSpe, it's worth it
[11:59:51] <Laspandrea> at the end of the round too

[11:59:57] <Laspandrea> !stats

[12:00:44] <leaf-green> !stats leaf-green

[12:01:20] <Sou> whats the best way to improve memory
[12:01:22] <Blink> memorize the ones with easy numbers, then? like valerie is 99
[12:01:36] <Mijzelffan> say it in a rhytmic way
[12:01:40] <Mijzelffan> the sequence
[12:01:43] <~Rapidash-Trivia> For the record, there's a bank of over 600 questions that we're using for this, with 150 questions picked from random each round. We'll be increasing the bank of questions for next year to over 2000.
[12:01:47] <Sou> at this point though, it would be kinda crazy to change that though, being so many have stuck around for multiple rounds
[12:01:57] <Soki> that's better, increasing the bank
[12:01:58] <~Rapidash-Trivia> Full stats will be posted on the forums hopefully some time before Christmas.
[12:01:58] <Mijzelffan> but like not all the same questions come back
[12:01:59] <leaf-green> you really wanna memorize in 3 hours?
[12:02:00] <Chibster> oo we gotta study harder hahah
[12:02:02] <Soki> cause they repeated so often
[12:02:03] <Mijzelffan> but you know the kind of questions that come back
[12:02:08] <Mijzelffan> like pokespe skills and tms
[12:02:10] <Mijzelffan> so you can prepare
[12:02:21] <Soki> oh no I've got the skills written down too:P
[12:02:22] <Soki> and the horoscope
[12:02:31] <ewormPL> Wait, next year?
[12:02:36] <ewormPL> This is annual confirmed?
[12:02:36] <Mijzelffan> tcg sets is the most important list imo lmao
[12:02:39] <Sou> same for horoscope and skills but my windows blocked them a bunch lol
[12:02:40] <Blink> don't write them down, memorize them! WAY faster
[12:02:44] <Soki> but that one's so long D:
[12:02:51] <~Rapidash-Trivia> So, do you want a practice round for glory or not? ;)
[12:02:52] <Soki> I. can't. memorize
[12:02:52] <Blink> horoscope is fast
[12:02:54] <Sou> i cant memorize D:
[12:02:58] <Chibster> TCG is usually Neo Genesis EX Ruby and Sapphire Black and White XY
[12:02:58] <Blink> yes you can! positivity
[12:03:04] <Soki> no lol
[12:03:04] <Blink> noble victories
[12:03:09] <leaf-green> it's mainly the speed
[12:03:10] <Soki> I've been to school, I know I can't
[12:03:15] <ctoborg> except seedot, which is ex sandstorm
[12:03:15] <~Rapidash-Trivia> Stopping the trivia. !trivia to restart.
[12:03:18] <Soki> it's not worth an 15 euro amiibo:P
[12:03:20] <Sou> i think the ruby and sapphire only came up once this wrong lol
[12:03:31] <Laspandrea> !stats Mijzelffan
[12:03:32] <Sou> round*
[12:03:35] <Blink> it's not really memorizing though, it's cramming
[12:03:37] <Blink> so you can do it
[12:03:47] <Sou> I just want the Pit amiibo since it came out xD
[12:03:51] <ctoborg> !stats ctoborg
[12:03:54] <Serpentsounds> speed is important, but if you don't know any of the answers in the first place it doesn't really help :p
[12:03:56] <Serpentsounds> <-- case in point
[12:03:59] <Soki> I"ve got the pit amiibo! =D
[12:04:04] <Sou> aw maannnn
[12:04:06] <Soki> speed is so important
[12:04:07] <Sou>  jealous! xD
[12:04:09] <Chibster> Pittoo!
[12:04:10] <leaf-green> people crammed more for this than they crammed in school XD
[12:04:13] <ctoborg> also, having faster internet than everyone else helps
[12:04:16] <Mijzelffan> I know I did lmao
[12:04:24] <Mijzelffan> I don't think fast internet matters
[12:04:25] <Blink> yeah but you can't really change that :P
[12:04:26] <Chibster> hahah leaf-green it was better than studying for math haha
[12:04:29] <Sou> my internet speed is gonna dip next round orz
[12:04:30] <Mijzelffan> since it just saves the send time and compares it
[12:04:34] <Blink> nah, studying for this is fun
[12:04:36] <Sou> not sure if its worth it for me lol
[12:04:40] <Mijzelffan> that's why the person who appears first doesn't always win
[12:04:43] <Soki> not worth it for me at least
[12:04:51] <Mijzelffan> I guess it matter for seeing the question though
[12:04:58] <leaf-green> maths is fun Chibster hahahahahaha ;-;
[12:05:01] <ctoborg> fast internet does matter, because ive had times where my correct answer showed up in chat before someone else and they got the point
[12:05:01] <Soki> the questions should be more varivied really, so you CAN'T memorize them
[12:05:02] <Soki> or make a list
[12:05:02] <Mijzelffan> download seped matters, upload speed doesn't
[12:05:07] <Blink> think about it this way: there's only 1 more round, so if you want to study, now's your chance
[12:05:07] <Chibster> hahaha 
[12:05:08] <Serpentsounds> send time? wot

[12:05:21] <Mijzelffan> "fast internet does matter, because ive had times where my correct answer showed up in chat before someone else and they got the point" that happens to literally everyone
[12:05:30] <Soki> yep
[12:05:30] <Chibster> yes yes yes
[12:05:33] <Chibster> so true
[12:05:40] <leaf-green> there's 600 questions... though somehow we've randomly been getting the same ones
[12:05:44] <Sou> my cousin who lives here likes to download and stream videos off the net lol.. he's asleep now though but not next round xD
[12:05:59] <Blink> ethernet?
[12:06:05] <leaf-green> plus we've been in so many rounds so we recognize before we read
[12:06:08] <ctoborg>  i really wish i could just type faster, lol
[12:06:08] <Sou> i dont have a cable ; v;
[12:06:14] <Blink> oh :/
[12:06:49] <Soki> who's here next round?
[12:06:58] <Sou> I'ma try!
[12:06:58] <leaf-green> Aye
[12:07:00] <Sou> for Pit!
[12:07:10] <Laspandrea> me
[12:07:38] <Soki> nice now I know who to assassinate in three hours:P
[12:07:46] <Blink> lol
[12:08:00] <Serpentsounds> http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english practice!
[12:08:04] <Sou> but how can you assassinate... a ninja?!
[12:08:13] <Soki> by being a ninja myself!
[12:08:17] <Sou>  /gasp
[12:08:22] <Sou> OBJECTION
[12:08:24] <~Rapidash-Trivia> 600 questions, but 150 questions per round, so you'll get about 1 in 4 questions the same.
[12:08:47] <Soki> you cannot object to me being a ninja
[12:08:58] <Soki> that's against the rules
[12:09:01] <Sou>  OVERULED
[12:09:05] <ewormPL> We can see You - ergo not ninja
[12:09:26] <~Rapidash-Trivia> Of course, all questions have been done in multiple rounds by now. Though there was 1 question which didn't show up at all until Round 9 or 10.
[12:09:33] <ewormPL> Real ninja is that guy that's not showing on the list on the right
[12:09:39] <Sou> i need to remember my Phoenix wright vocab...
[12:09:42] <Soki> yeah there were a few I've never seen in the last 5 rounds
[12:09:55] <Blink> phoenix wright is great
[12:10:00] <Sou> it is xD
[12:10:06] <Sou> I love the games <3
[12:10:07] <leaf-green> oh Rapidash-Trivia it used to be 609 now it's 608 which question got removed?
[12:10:09] <Soki> still got to play those games some time
[12:10:23] <Blink> you have to, they are so much fun
[12:10:27] <Sou> they're pretty fun if you dont mind them :>
[12:10:29] <Blink> and so intense
[12:10:32] <leaf-green> phoenix wright rules
[12:10:34] <Sou> hehe yeah
[12:10:42] <~Rapidash-Trivia> I'm not certain. I was asleep when it was removed.
[12:10:53] <Soki> they did it secretly
[12:11:05] <Soki> you were not allowed to know
[12:11:11] <Blink> true ninjas right there
[12:11:20] <Soki> it was sou
[12:11:21] <Soki> sou removed it
[12:11:24] <leaf-green> it was ninjask
[12:11:28] <Blink> gasp
[12:11:33] <Soki> plot twist
[12:11:39] <Mijzelffan> the dark matter one I bet
[12:11:46] <ewormPL> It was the mighty Triviathan
[12:12:09] <ewormPL> Seriously though, this contest is insane
[12:12:12] <leaf-green> or ShinyLinoone haha
[12:12:18] <Soki> it is with so many people
[12:12:24] <Soki> there were only 5 playing last round
[12:12:36] <Blink> last round was at 4am my time
[12:13:07] <Soki> and then there's mijzelf who just remembers everything
[12:13:13] <Soki> and types inhumanly fast so yeah:P
[12:13:26] <Blink> but now that mij is gone, someone needs to take up the slack and memorize TMs XD
[12:13:26] <Mijzelffan> you should've seen chibster
[12:13:31] <Chibster> hahahaha
[12:13:32] <Blink> oh my gosh yes
[12:13:34] <Soki> I've seen chibster too
[12:13:36] <Chibster> i was super pumped
[12:13:37] <Blink> chibster is insane
[12:13:39] <leaf-green> as have i
[12:13:40] <Soki> every round there's that one person
[12:13:44] <leaf-green> and blink
[12:13:44] <ewormPL> Were the other rounds also this landslided?
[12:13:50] <leaf-green> and TheArchive
[12:13:55] <leaf-green> and sebek5000
[12:13:55] <Blink> not THIS landslided, no
[12:13:56] <Mijzelffan> chibster and thearchive were both faster than me but they won
[12:13:57] <Soki> no there was a round which was almost a tie
[12:13:57] <Mijzelffan> so then there was just me
[12:14:00] <Mijzelffan> pieguy was super fast too though
[12:14:03] <Mijzelffan> he just didn't know as much
[12:14:13] <leaf-green> pieguy you're pretty fly

[12:14:43] <pieguy> aww shucks
[12:14:43] <Mijzelffan> I didn't break thearchive's record did I?
[12:14:45] <ewormPL> So a round lasts about an hour?
[12:14:53] <Soki> but the rounds I've been in there was always one or two people that seemed to know everything
[12:14:55] <Soki> yes
[12:14:59] <Soki> an hour
[12:15:06] <leaf-green> i think TheArchive had over 60
[12:15:09] <ewormPL> It was Mijzelffan's family
[12:15:17] <Soki> yeah archive broke two records
[12:15:19] <Mijzelffan> maybe you'll be that guy next round soki
[12:15:21] <Jatayu> Well, that's mostly because we've been here for 6 rounds or so
[12:15:26] <Chibster> yeah Soki!
[12:15:42] <Soki> nah I doubt it haha
[12:15:42] <Blink> yeah, I think I played 6 or 7 before I won
[12:15:49] <Blink> you can do it soki! 
[12:15:56] <Chibster> First 2 rounds were insane
[12:15:57] <Soki> I've got a donut once
[12:15:58] <Mijzelffan> just remember that when in doubt the answer is none, torchic or alomomola
[12:15:59] <Soki> it's good enough
[12:16:05] <Chibster> there were like 3 ppl who knew everything
[12:16:07] <Jatayu> or sawsbuck
[12:16:08] <Soki> remember alomomola is not the problem
[12:16:10] <Soki> it's typing it:P
[12:16:12] <leaf-green> the first round was fun... at 2a.m
[12:16:12] <Chibster> or feebas
[12:16:13] <Blink> feebas!!!
[12:16:15] <Blink> yes
[12:16:19] <Chibster> hahah yesh!
[12:16:23] <ewormPL> Encourage people to provide feedback in the contest's forum thread. Maybe next year's edition could be even better.
[12:16:25] <Mijzelffan> I always get the alomomola questions right because everyone else struggles typing it lmao
[12:16:34] <Blink> alomomomomomola
[12:16:35] <Chibster> hahahh
[12:16:36] <Chibster> momomomomo
[12:16:39] <ewormPL> Alomomola
[12:16:40] <leaf-green> hahaha
[12:16:44] <Jatayu> So I'm assuming this round is over? Just woke up.
[12:16:44] <ewormPL> It's easy
[12:16:49] <Chibster> Jatayu yep!
[12:16:52] <Soki> yeas this one's done
[12:16:55] <Jatayu> Who won?
[12:16:56] <Soki> mijzelffan won
[12:17:03] <Chibster> and he has a horde of donuts
[12:17:07] <Soki> memorized all the TM's
[12:17:11] <Soki> unbeatable
[12:17:23] <leaf-green> there's a whole winner circle going on here
[12:17:33] <Jatayu> Guessing Archive won the round before?
[12:17:37] <Soki> jep
[12:17:38] <Mijzelffan> yeah
[12:17:39] <Chibster> ibelieve so!
[12:17:40] <leaf-green> yup
[12:17:42] <Soki> broke two records doing it
[12:17:43] <Blink> hahaha easy to guess, right?
[12:17:45] <Soki> highest score
[12:17:46] <Mijzelffan> he was powered by sleep deprivation
[12:17:52] <Mijzelffan> so fast and so knowledgable
[12:18:10] <leaf-green> it was really close between you two though
[12:18:14] <Blink> really wishing I'd been there to watch now
[12:18:14] <ewormPL> By the way, what are Amiibo even for?
[12:18:20] <Soki> to look at!
[12:18:26] <Chibster> collecting, smash, other games
[12:18:26] <ewormPL> I know they can be added to some games...
[12:18:28] <Soki> to talk to
[12:18:29] <Mijzelffan> you can use them for games
[12:18:30] <leaf-green> to talk to
[12:18:32] <Sou> the WiiU and 3DS or figurines
[12:18:33] <Soki> haha
[12:18:39] <Jatayu> Yeah. Soki saved the day in the final question :D
[12:18:42] <Soki> yess
[12:18:47] <Soki> I did something right at least:P
[12:18:51] <Chibster> :D:D
[12:18:59] <Soki> got jatayu's donuts for it
[12:19:10] <Jatayu> Worth it
[12:19:16] <leaf-green> haha nice
[12:19:34] <ewormPL> Nendoroid > amiibo
[12:19:45] <Soki> true, but they're way more expensive
[12:19:53] <leaf-green> hey Chibster, any idea what's being traded today?
[12:19:56] <Soki> amiibo are at least affordable
[12:19:56] <Blink> what are nendoroid?
[12:20:05] <Soki> chibi figurines of some sort
[12:20:09] <Chibster> Leaf, let me check
[12:20:11] <Blink> oh, interesting
[12:20:22] <Soki> there's a red nendroid for example
[12:20:23] <Soki> look it up
[12:20:30] <Blink> will do
[12:20:44] <ewormPL> Warning, looking it up will cause cravings
[12:20:49] <Soki> true
[12:20:58] <Soki> beware
[12:21:23] <Chibster> leaf-green it's Cryogonal!
[12:21:36] <Chibster> i don't like it haha
[12:21:37] <Jatayu> I'm happy with getting a regular old King Dedede amiibo. Mostly because I don't think there's really any other merchandise of him out there.
[12:21:48] <Blink> oh gosh these are adorable
[12:21:53] <Chibster> yeah that's true, besides plushies
[12:21:57] <Soki> that's also nice about amiibo, finally figures of characters that don't have any merch
[12:22:00] <Chibster> Blink what amiibo are you getting?
[12:22:08] <Blink> don't know yet, actually
[12:22:09] <Jatayu> Like wii fit trainer :P

[12:22:45] <Soki> my own mini pit
[12:22:45] <Chibster> can't believe kid icarus uprising is expensive too
[12:23:07] <Soki> yeah the game isn't cheap either
[12:23:10] <Soki> after all these years
[12:23:13] <Soki> it's quite old already
[12:23:37] <Chibster> and it only came out like what, 3-4 years ago?
[12:23:54] <Chibster> it's one of the most epensive 3DS games already :o
[12:23:57] <Chibster> *expensive
[12:24:04] <Soki> 2012 
[12:24:08] <leaf-green> how much is it roughly?
[12:24:15] <Soki> I've paid 45 euros
[12:24:22] <Blink> wow, that's crazy
[12:24:23] <Soki> this year
[12:24:40] <Chibster> About 80$ USD new or 40 something used
[12:24:44] <Soki> though my country's games are expensive in general

[12:25:06] <Soki> oh wow that's even worse
[12:25:20] <Soki> but it's quite hard to get, I only found one webshop that sold the thing new
[12:25:29] <leaf-green> 720 in my country 
[12:25:41] <Soki> what dollars?
[12:25:46] <leaf-green> rands
[12:25:50] <Jatayu> Brazil?
[12:26:01] <Soki> ah 43 euros
[12:26:03] <leaf-green> R16 to 1 Euro
[12:26:04] <Soki> so about the same as here
[12:26:05] <Chibster> so it's like 47 usd
[12:26:12] <Blink> 4527 yen on Amazon
[12:26:16] <Blink> that's not as bad
[12:26:17] <Chibster> or 48 rounded
[12:26:28] <Chibster> true but it's region locked i think
[12:26:33] <Soki> yep
[12:26:35] <leaf-green> plus shipping?
[12:26:36] <Soki> all 3ds games are

[12:26:53] <Chibster> but you have to get a shipping service sometimes
[12:26:58] <Chibster> but i think they ship games internationally
[12:27:15] <Blink> yeah, shipping is annoying
[12:27:37] <Chibster> there's so many Pokemon plushies but they don't ship internationally ;~;
[12:27:40] <leaf-green> except brazil isn't it? Nintendo doesn't deal with them anymore or something
[12:27:52] <Chibster> really? :o
[12:28:09] <Chibster> oh yes just looked it up
[12:28:11] <Blink> didn't know that...
[12:28:14] <Jatayu> Yeah, something about their entertainment tariffs being absurd?
[12:28:17] <Chibster> that sucks :/
[12:28:26] <Soki> poor brazil people :(
[12:28:32] <Jatayu> Am I getting that right?

[13:48:12] <Chibster> i'm not going to even try that haha i'd spend hours and hours
[13:48:22] <Chibster> did you do the riddle thingy?
[13:48:41] <leaf-green> i did the scavenger... haven't started the 12 days yet
[13:49:10] <leaf-green> some of these questions were from past years 12 days of trivia 
[13:49:12] <Mijzelffan> I finished the scavenger hunt in two hours haha
[13:49:36] <Chibster> is it really that easy :o
[13:49:44] <leaf-green> two hours! Mijzelffan some of those passwords took me 2 hours
[13:49:48] <Mijzelffan> well last year I was actually the first to finish and I was second the year before that
[13:49:55] <Mijzelffan> but two hours is a new record for me haha
[13:50:04] <Mijzelffan> this year is really easy though
[13:50:05] <Jatayu> Finished scavenger hunt pretty easily
[13:50:06] <Chibster> so how many winners are picked for that?
[13:50:20] <Mijzelffan> one at random
[13:50:28] <Jatayu> Beside the scrambled phrase
[13:50:32] <Mijzelffan> finish order no longer matters
[13:50:44] <Mijzelffan> it didn't last year either but I still ended up winning randomly haha
[13:50:48] <Chibster> yeah i guess that's better
[13:50:49] <Chibster> hahah
[13:53:16] <Mijzelffan> the 12th days trivia is brutal as always though, only managed to get 4 answers so far
[13:53:17] <leaf-green> it's the same with the trivia... as long as you get them all they pick at random
[13:53:54] <leaf-green> ah really?
